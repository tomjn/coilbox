# Mission runtime

The Lua that plays a coilbox scenario inside the engine. It is coilbox-authored and game-agnostic: a game vendors a copy, and coilbox installs and updates it (see the [scenario editor design](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-31-scenario-editor-design.md)).

## Layout

- `luarules/gadgets/coilbox_mission_runtime.lua`, the gadget. It gates on the modoption, loads the compiled mission, and hands it to the rest of the runtime.
- `missions/runtime.lua`, the version marker and capability table. Coilbox reads it out of an installed game to decide what the editor may offer.
- `tests/`, checks that run outside the engine with `luajit`. Not part of what a game vendors.

A game vendoring the runtime takes `luarules/`, `luaui/` and `missions/`, and nothing else.

## How a mission starts

Coilbox writes `coilbox_mission = <scenario id>` into the start script and the compiled scenario to `missions/<id>/mission.lua` in the game. Without that modoption the gadget chunk returns `false`, so the gadget handler drops it before it reads a file or defines a callin: a normal game is unaffected.

With it, the gadget loads `missions/runtime.lua` and the compiled mission, refuses a mission that needs a newer runtime than this one, and publishes both on `GG.CoilboxMission`:

```lua
GG.CoilboxMission = { id = <scenario id>, mission = <compiled scenario>, runtime = <runtime.lua> }
```

`mission` is the compiled scenario exactly as coilbox emitted it, so a misbehaving mission can be diagnosed by reading `missions/<id>/mission.lua` beside the scenario JSON.

## Conventions

- Everything vendored is named `coilbox_*` so a game maintainer can see at a glance which files came from here.
- The gadget file is loaded twice, once synced and once unsynced. Put synced-only work behind `gadgetHandler:IsSyncedCode()`, and keep anything that runs in both deterministic.
- Files under `missions/` are data. They are read with an empty environment, so they may not call the engine or touch globals.
- Adding a condition or action type means adding it to `missions/runtime.lua` and bumping `version` in the same change. A type that has shipped is never removed: a scenario asking for it would then silently do nothing.

## Tests

```sh
luajit lua/mission-runtime/tests/gate_test.lua
```
